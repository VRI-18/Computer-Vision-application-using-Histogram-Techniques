# Computer-Vision-application-using-Histogram-Techniques
This project focused on building a computer vision application that improves the quality of medical/biological images using histogram-based techniques. The main idea was to enhance contrast and highlight important features in the images so that downstream analysis or diagnosis becomes more accurate.
