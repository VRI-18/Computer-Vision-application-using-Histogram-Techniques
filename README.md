# Computer-Vision-application-using-Histogram-Techniques
This project focused on building a computer vision application that improves the quality of medical/biological images using histogram-based techniques. The main idea was to enhance contrast and highlight important features in the images so that downstream analysis or diagnosis becomes more accurate.
What Was Done:
Dataset Preparation
Collected raw images (possibly medical/dermatology/biological samples).
Used Excel to maintain labels, keep track of image versions (raw vs enhanced), and record results after processing.

Image Enhancement
Applied histogram equalization and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to remove poor lighting effects and improve clarity.

Resized and normalized the dataset for consistency.
Evaluation & Results

Compared original vs processed images using metrics (entropy, histogram distribution, visual clarity).
Documented results in Excel for easy analysis and visualization.
